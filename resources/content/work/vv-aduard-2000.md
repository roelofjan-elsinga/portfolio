# VV Aduard 2000

I made a website for my old football club with the PHP Framework Laravel. 
This website is fully responsive and has an extensive admin dashboard.

I've included a Twitter feed on the left side. Recently (July 2018), 
I've rebuilt part of the website to accomodate for dynamic pages. 
This was one of the first Laravel websites I've created, so it was mostly hardcoded.
Adding pages was very tedious, so I decided to take some extra time and make this process a bit easier.
Now it has a template system, so when you want a custom layout for a specific page, 
you can very easily add this. If you choose not to add a custom template, the page will be displayed as an image, 
some text, and a list of attached files, if present.

### Tools used
- Laravel
