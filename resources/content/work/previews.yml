      Science of any kind is a subject I love to talk about. So I was thrilled when I was asked
      to build a website for Tracerlab and contribute to science in one way or another.
      If I can't do it through academic research, I'll do it through building a website for a great project.

      With Plant care for beginners I'm sharing my experiences about caring for plants. I want to help to
      educate others about keeping their plants healthy and how to help them thrive. The goal is to write
      about plants I actually care for myself, so I can write about all kinds of tips and tricks that you
      may not know if you just copy and paste other guides.
