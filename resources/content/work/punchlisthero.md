# PunchlistHero

This project is all about efficiency. 
Currently this project is used by a few people at a construction company. 
Traditionally, they are using pen and paper to write down issues they find while inspecting houses. 
This takes a lot of time and could easily be solved with a clever digital solution.
This is why I offered to help make this process quick and mostly automatic.

### Tools used
To accomplish this goal, there were several tools I used:
- PHP (Laravel)
- MySQL Database
- Elasticsearch: searching and smart matching of entities
