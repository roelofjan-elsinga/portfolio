# Ankrd Media

Ankrd media is a small company that owns a few products, like Ankrd. It's aimed to managed the different 
outlets of the Ankrd platform. I made this static website as a way to show what the company does. 
The layout was a fun challenge and this was the first website I had created using flexbox.

### What's my role in this project?
I was responsible for creating the website. I had a design that I built in HTML + SCSS.

### Tools used
To accomplish this goal, there were several tools I used:
- HTML
- SCSS (+flexbox)
