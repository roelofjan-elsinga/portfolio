      I've written several articles about things I was working on.
      Writing about my projects and problems helped me to reflect on my development
      choices and to keep learning new things and improving on old skills.

      Here you can read about the things I do in my free-time. Unlike my blog posts about my professional development,
      these are about the other good things in life. My job keeps me glued to my computer for at least 8 hours per day
      so I try to find activities that have nothing to do with that.
