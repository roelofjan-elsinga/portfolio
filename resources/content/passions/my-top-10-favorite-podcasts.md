# My top 10 favorite podcasts
I listen to podcasts almost every single day, so I've compiled a list of my top 10 favorite ones. 
I usually listen to them on my way to and from work and they're an excellent way to learn something 
by just listening to some knowledgable people speak. 

- [Full stack radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/)
- [Frontend Happy Hour](https://frontendhappyhour.com/)
- [Akimbo: A podcast from Seth Godin](https://www.akimbo.me/)
- [StarTalk Radio](https://www.startalkradio.net/)
- [Rework](https://rework.fm/)
- [The GaryVee Audio Experience](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/podcast/)
- [Couples therapy with Candice and Casey](https://anchor.fm/couples-therapy)
- [The Six Figure Freelancer Audio-Course](https://player.fm/series/the-six-figure-freelancer-audio-course)
- [The Entrepreneurial Coder Podcast](https://www.ecpodcast.io/)
- [The Laracasts Snippet](https://laracasts.com/podcast)

As you can see, there is quite a pattern in those different podcasts: programming and business. 
I mean there are two different ones, an interest of mine (space, science) and a podcast about 
relationships. 

These podcasts keep me up with topics in the development community and help me shape a business 
around a product. I listen to all the business podcasts because I'd love to start my own 
company at some point. I listen to the podcasts about building your own business, 
because I would not want to get investors and answer to others about MY business.

## The programming podcasts
The programming podcasts from this list are the following:
- Full stack radio
- Frontend Happy Hour
- The Laracasts Snippet

These go into developer experiences, new programming techniques, 
how to test and how to deal with certain problems. 
These really help to explain some topics or solve some of the problems I have on a day-to-day basis.

## The Business podcasts
The business podcasts that I listen to are all about the business itself, 
starting a business, and running a business efficiently. 
The ones from my top 10 about business are:
- Akimbo: A podcast from Seth Godin
- Rework
- The GaryVee Audio Experience
- The Six Figure Freelancer Audio-Course
- The Entrepreneurial Coder Podcast

I'm interested in starting a business at some point and these podcasts highlight do's and don'ts for 
doing so. The overall theme is to be patient and to market the business early on. 
One of my goals is to never have any outside investors because I don't want to answer 
to anyone but myself about my own business. Investors give you a nice boost, 
but if your business is sound and you can make the money yourself, through clients, 
it's a much better option. Because all you do is to serve your clients better. 
If you take outside investments, you have to serve your investors as well and this won't always 
benefit the people that are actually paying for your service. 

So if you're interested in business or building a business, definitely give these podcasts a try.

## The science podcast
Star Talk Radio is my go-to podcast for anything science related. 
They talk about a range of topics within the science community. 
Most of the podcasts are about something space or space travel related, 
but there are definitely a good amount of episodes on other topics.

Science has been interesting to me for a long time. Unfortunately, 
that interest started after I was able to take any science classes in school. 
I now learn about new developments through my own research and reading books. 
Being able to figure out what a Quantum Particle is, is pretty exciting. 

## The relationship podcast
In "Couples therapy with Candice and Casey", obviously you hear about Candice and Casey's 
relationship, but it's more. When listening to it, I'm thinking of ways that I could 
better my relationship or different ways to communicate certain things. 
It's interesting to see another couple go through certain processes and learn from their mistakes.

Do you have any good podcasts you listen to occasionally? Do you listen to any of these podcasts, 
if so, what do you think of them?
