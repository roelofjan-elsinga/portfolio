## How have I built this website?

I've built this website with a few different technologies. 
Some of them I use more often than others:
            
#### Laravel
I've used <a href="https://laravel.com/" class="link link--underline">Laravel</a> 
to keep everything in place and to serve the content on this website. 
I've been using Laravel for every single project for the past 
4 years and keep discovering new features every day.

#### Tailwindcss + SCSS
I'm a full-stack web developer and no front-end developer, so I know how to CSS, 
because it's part of my job. However, I don't find writing CSS enjoyable or 
interesting in any way. This is why I'm using 
<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="link link--underline">Tailwindcss</a> for all 
my styling on this website. When the utility classes get repetitive, I replace them with 
reusable classes which are all defined in SCSS files.

#### Markdown
Do you enjoy all the content on this website? Well that's all written in 
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/" class="link link--underline">Markdown</a>. 
That's right...this website doesn't make use of a database. 
Since this is a simple website with some content, 
I'm simply writing all content in markdown files, just like I would on Github. 
This helps me focus on the content rather than the styling.

#### Yaml
Can you see the meta tags of this website? These are all defined in 
<a href="https://yaml.org/" class="link link--underline">Yaml</a> files. 
Again, not making use of a database for the purpose of having dynamic meta tags. 
This allows me to keep the content in Git version control.

#### XML
I'm generating several XML files through some simple commands on this website.
The first is a 
<a href="https://roelofjanelsinga.com/sitemap.xml" class="link link--underline">sitemap</a> 
of all of the pages on this website, 
and the second is an 
<a href="https://roelofjanelsinga.com/feed" class="link link--underline">Atom feed</a> 
for all of my blog posts.

#### Design inspiration
I'm not a great designer, so I couldn't have built this website without an 
excellent example made by
<a href="http://www.gilhuybrecht.com/" class="link link--underline">Gil Huybrecht</a>. 

#### Don't believe me?
