## About me

![Roelof Jan Elsinga](/images/image_bw.png "This is me")

I'm currently working as a lead developer at Tubber. I'm working on a platform to facilitate C2C and C2B boat rental all over the world.  

My education was spent as a fulltime student at Hanze Hogeschool Groningen / University of Applied Science Groningen. 
I majored in Web & Mobile Services, which is part of the Communications and Media department of the University. 
My bachelor's thesis was completed on the usage of Big data to influence people to trigger a behavioral change.

I've spent one year in the United States of America between my last year of high school in the Netherlands and my first year of University. 
I went there to learn to speak English, experience another culture, and improve my mathematical skills (all of which have been accomplished).

At the beginning of my third year at the Hanzehogeschool Groningen I went abroad for a minor and an internship. 
I spent my first semester at Hope College in Holland, MI, USA. I attended classes relating to communications, leadership, and computer science. 
This helped me to not only develop software, but also sell it to people.

In the second semester of my third year I did a programming internship at SPIN Internet Media in Willemstad, Curacao. 
This is where I first learned to work with Laravel and AngularJS. Through the years, I've kept working with these frameworks.
I've recently switched to the newer version of Angular.
