## About me

![Roelof Jan Elsinga](/images/image_bw.png "This is me")

Currently I'm working as a web app developer at Tubbber, a start up to put a modern spin to the traditional boat rental market in the world.

My education was spend as a fulltime student at Hanze Hogeschool Groningen / University of Applied Science Groningen. I majored in Web & Mobile Services, which is part of the Communications and Media department of the University. My bachelor's thesis was completed on the usage of Big data to influence people to trigger a behavioral change.

I've spent one year in the United States of America between my last year of high school in the Netherlands and my first year of University. I went there to learn to speak English, experience another culture, and improve my mathematical skills (all of which have been accomplished).

At the beginning of my third year at the Hanzehogeschool Groningen I went abroad for a minor and an internship. I spent my first semester at Hope College in Holland, MI, USA. I attended classes relating to communications, leadership, and computer science. I think this benefitted my future career within the web development work field. 
In the second semester of my third year I did a programming internship at SPIN Internet Media in Willemstad, Curacao.
