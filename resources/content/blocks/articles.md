# Articles

Over the years, I've written several articles about things I was working on at that time. 
Writing about my projects and problems I was facing helped me to reflect on my development choices. 
Revisiting some of the problems I was facing, helped to ultimately solve the problems. 
I also view these posts as a view into the past, I can see exactly what I was learning to use at the 
time of writing the articles. This helps me to keep learning new things and improving on old skills.
