# Why I built my own CMS
I've always been against building my own content management system. It's always been a huge drag to me when anyone asked me to do something like it, so I just went with off-the-shelf solutions like WordPress. This was always enough for me, because I wasn't building the websites for myself. I was always convinced that I could create my content more easily by just creating HTML files and serving that as content. I was also against using a CMS, because that would cost me time and effort to set it up, connect it to a database, and update it regularly. So why on earth did I create my own CMS then? There are two reasons for this:

- If I need anything, I can build it.
- If I don't like it, I can change it.

But you can do this with any other CMS. Yes, you're right. I have nothing to say against that, because you're absolutely right in saying that. However, for me, the reasons to build my own CMS went slightly deeper than: "I can do this better". I wanted to learn to solve problems when building an application in a limited environment. 

## The history of my CMS
In the beginning, the CMS wasn't even a CMS. It was simply my portfolio, running on a Laravel application, with a database to persist the data. I hadn't updated on my website in two years and my blog was running on a subdomain. I gave my website a makeover and wanted to do the same for my blog, to make it blend in with my website. This was a struggle, so I decided to simply read the data for the blog into the laravel application and just serve it from my blog instead. This worked really well...until I pulled my website from GitHub to make some adjustments. Now I didn't have any blog posts, portfolio items, or any other content. All of this content was saved in a remote database, protected by a firewall. This meant I had to download two different databases and get this to work on my local machine. I wasn't prepared to do this. Instead, I copied all of my content into HTML files and served them from the filesystem. This worked well and it was fast. All content was available through version control and it didn't matter on which system I was working on my website, the content was always right there. 

So why did I make this into a separate CMS module? Well this is where the story gets interesting. At this time, I started a second blog for [Plant care for Beginners](https://plantcareforbeginners.com). As I was convinced of the way I could utilize HTML and Markdown files to serve static content and just edit the content of my posts through my code editor, I wanted to copy/paste my portfolio website including blog for this new blog. And this is literally what I did, you might still be able to find references from this new blog to my old website. I copy/pasted my portfolio, removed all stuff I didn't need and got started on writing content for the plant blog. But...I found a bug. When I fixed it, I thought: "Well now I have to fix this blog in 2 places, that's annoying". This led me to extract the CMS into a Composer package, this process was completed in a few days of slowly migrating parts of the websites to the package. In the end I had a fully headless CMS that was managing all content of both of the blogs, both my personal blog and the plant blog. 

This is the moment where I thought: "You know what, I kind of want to be able to edit my content on my phone as well!". At that point the only way to edit content was to edit HTML and Markdown files on my laptop through code editors. This worked well, but what if I had inspiration to write but wasn't close to a computer? I could edit the post on GitHub in their file editor, but every change would need a commit and I only wrote a few sentences at a time, this would add up to a lot of commits for a single post. Initially, I started writing my blog posts on Google Drive. This worked really well for the longest time. The reason I got tired of that was the fact that after finishing the blog post, I had to copy/paste it to Markdown files, convert the wysiwyg content to Markdown and then commit and push the changes. I could write the content on my phone, but I couldn't publish it from my phone.

What I needed was a way to be able to edit my content directly in the browser and then publish it to the world from my phone, so I got to work. I created a new package, called [roelofjan-elsinga/flat-file-cms-gui](https://github.com/roelofjan-elsinga/flat-file-cms-gui). This would simply be a Graphical User Interface that utilized my headless CMS to allow me to edit all my content in the browser. I kept adding features, like being able to choose from a HTML or Markdown editor. This helped me to support some of my earlier posts that were all written in HTML files. Since all of my newer posts are written in Markdown, I added a markdown editor in the GUI, which allowed me to create and edit posts from anywhere. The headless CMS can parse files and return the content as HTML to allow my blog to display them to readers, but it can also just return the raw data, so I can edit the content in a HTML or Markdown editor. 

As you might have noticed, my posts all have a featured image at the top of the page, these images are also displayed in the overview of all blog posts. The images in the overview are actually a thumbnail with a maximum width of 300 pixels. When I was working on blog posts through my code editor, I had to manually resize images to create featured images that are 1200 pixels wide and thumbnails of those images that are 300 pixels wide. This got old really quickly and when the GUI of my CMS was ready, I built a service that could do this for my automatically. All I had to do was upload an image and tell the system if I need a thumbnail for that image. After it had uploaded, I could copy the link and place it in my markdown files. The system would automatically display the correct thumbnail in the overviews. No more tedious work that the application could do for me automatically, awesome!

So in the end, building my own CMS was just a coincidence.
