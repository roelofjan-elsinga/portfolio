# Improving development hiring

When applying to development jobs, you're often asked to do a coding test to prove that you know what you're doing. I think this is terrible and here are better ways to figure out if someone is a good fit for the job, the team, and the company:

#### 1. Trial period of a few weeks

Let the developer work together with your developers in a team on real projects, just as if the developer was already hired. Coding is only 5% of the job. Communication skills, team work, and culture fit are so much more important. A person can learn how to code, but not learn how to be a team player, and a person to perfectly for in your company. Hire based on team fit, not just coding skills.

#### 2. Open source work
Has the applicant worked on any personal projects? Perfect! Use that to judge the programming skills. It's much better to look at code that a person enjoyed writing then code that's being forced into a limited timeframe. Look at how they comment their code, and whether they take care of something simple as a consistent coding style and formatting. A passionate and organized developer is what you want, don't judge them by the forced positivity of a coding test.
