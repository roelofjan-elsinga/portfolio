# How I write my blog posts in 6 steps
Writing blogs can be a daunting task if you're not someone that writes a lot. I used to be this person, but I learned to enjoy writing by writing. The act of writing, made me improve my skills and after a while I started to enjoy writing more and more. Now, almost 3 years after I've written my first blog post, I can look back at old posts and see the progress I've made since then. These are all motivating factors to keep writing blog posts. But what is my process? How do I get to writing these posts? There are a few simple steps anyone could follow: 

1. Find a topic
2. Brainstorm about things you can talk about regarding the topic
3. Start writing without self-editing
4. Revise your story to create a storyline
5. Revise your grammar and spelling
6. Find visual aids to support your story

## 1. Find a topic
Finding a topic is usually the most difficult step out of the 5 steps. A lot of people will self edit before they've even started to write, including picking a topic to write about. Thoughts like "Why would anyone want to read that?" or "There are already 1000 posts about this" are very common, but shouldn't deter you from picking a topic. The only two questions you should ask yourself about a topic are these:

1. Do I enjoy writing about the topic?
2. Do I have something to say about the topic?

Do you see the silver lining here? Picking a topic is all about what YOU think, not what anyone else thinks. They're not the one writing the post for you, you are. If you really enjoy writing about a certain topic, go for it! The second question is also an important question. I deliberately didn't say "Do I have something NEW to say about the topic?", because it's simply not the most important thing here. There will be others that could really benefit from learning about your perspective on the topic. Sure, there could be 1000's of other posts about the subject on the internet, but if you can share your perspective on it, no matter how specific to your situation, you might be able to help somehow in some way. 

Let your voice be heard. Even if nobody else cares, you still have a blog post that might help yourself out in the future.

## 2. Brainstorm about things you can talk about regarding the topic
When you've found a topic you want to write about, it's a good idea to come up with a list of possible angles you wish to explore in your post. These angles can highlight the different aspects of your topic and they help the reader understand your perspective more easily. You can start out with a very basic bullet point list. Just write down everything that can support your point. A little spoiler: that's how I got these 5 steps for this blog posts. If I were to share screenshots from the very beginning of this post, you'd see something like this:

- Come up with something to write about
- Create an outline of what you want to write about (in my case this is just a list of possible angles for the topic)
- Start writing and don't self edit. You need all the ideas from your head onto the screen.
- Revise the post to get a clear story line. (Screenreaders)
- Revise your grammar and spelling. (Grammarly and Hemmingway App)

As you can see, I'm just coming up with a few things you might be able to use to explain to the readers what my process is, with some very bare comments and hints that I might revisit later on. I realise what I'm doing now is very meta, but this is what my process looks like. So once you have a few different angles you can use to highlight your topic from different angles, you can move onto the next step, my favorite step.

## 3. Start writing without self-editing
My favorite step is just putting words on the screen. If you don't know where to start, just write down a few buzzwords or words that are vaguely related to your topic. The main goal is to get words on the page and to get your creative thoughts flowing. Once you start to write and you get into a flow, you will type words very quickly. You need to record all of your thoughts into words. Don't focus on making things sound and flow nicely. Don't even worry about making sense or using grammar rules correctly. Solely focus on transforming thoughts into words. This is the part of the process where you will likely write way too many words for your post, but that's okay, because in the next few steps you'll be revising your text 2, 3, maybe even 4 times and the sentences will start to make sense. 

Most of my posts grow to about 1500-2000 words, but after the revisions this settles at about 750-900 words. If you feel like you've written everything you can about a certain aspect, but you're not yet satisfied with point you're trying to make, just skip to the next paragraph and come back to the other one later. Writing is not always a linear process, sometimes you add sentences all over the place until you're satisfied with the overall story.

## 4. Revise your story to create a storyline
When you've written your heart out in step 3, you've probably written 4 or 5 stories in one post. This is only natural when you're not self editing and this is totally fine. During this fourth step, you're going to tie knots and create 1 coherent story out of everything you've written. You're taking the reader by the hand and you're helping them to get through your story by using the path of least resistance. You need to remind your readers what you were talking about earlier in your story and reference back to those mentions to tie some knots and make the story make sense for your readers. If you've created 5 different stories, your readers will get confused quite easily, because they'll feel like they've missed some information, because all of a sudden they've landed in another story. When you can tie the new paragraph to something the reader already knows, in this case some points you made earlier, you'll pull them back on your storyline and they'll be likely to understand what you mean and where you're going to go with your story.

You can also use a screenreader, because listening to your post helps you identify parts of your story that seem to be in the wrong place.

## 5. Revise your grammar and spelling
When you made it this far into your process, you've written a great and coherent story. It would be a shame if you published your well crafted story with grammatical errors, because a lot of people will stop reading after they've seen too many mistakes, no matter how great your story is. So don't give them the easy way out and do some of the hard work by cleaning up your sentences. There are a few great applications to help you with this: Grammarly and Hemmingway App. These applications check your spelling and tone, letting you know if the sentences you use are easy to understand, if they're activating or maybe too passive, and if you've made any spelling mistakes. It's not a flawless process, but it does find the majority of your mistakes and helps you fix them.

## 6. Find visual aids to support your story
You've come to the last step of the process. It's time to find some visual aids to support your story. These are usually just some photos that help clarify your story and help the reader to visualize what you're talking about.
