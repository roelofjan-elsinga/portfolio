# Job satisfaction

**Optimal Working Conditions**
Not met, room too loud, often distracted by questions, laptop not up to the task.

**Opportunity for Advancement**
None, still doing the same thing, no one to learn from, so I have to put in overtime to do this myself.

**Workload and Stress Level**
Too high, I'm doing 2 jobs and it's only boring tasks, killing my creativity and chances for exploration.

**Respect from Co-Workers**
Good, apart from the distractions and lack of respect for basic office etiquette to work in silence.

**Relationship with Supervisors**
Good

**Financial Rewards**
Far too low.
