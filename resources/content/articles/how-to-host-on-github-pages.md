# How to host a lightning fast website on Github Pages
When you have a website that's either static or doesn't require a database, you have a lot of options when it comes to hosting your website. One of them is hosting your website right out of your GitHub repository through GitHub pages. In this post I'm going to explain what GitHub Pages is and how you can use it to host your website on the reliable GitHub servers, for free. Yes, that's right, hosting a website on GitHub pages is free, but only when using a public repository.  

## How hosting works


## Hosting a private repository
You can host a website on GitHub pages, even if the repository is private. When your repository is private, there are a few limitations when it comes to hosting it through GitHub pages. As Github describes on their documentation ["About GitHub Pages"](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages): 

GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server.

So yes, you can host a website from a private repository, but you'll need to upgrade your plan to a paid plan. This is quite cheap though, so it might be worth it for you.
