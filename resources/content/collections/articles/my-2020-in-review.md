# My 2020 in review
2020 has been a strange year for us all, but I don't want to linger on the negatives for too long. In this post, I'll highlight everything I've learned this year and everything I'm proud of.

## Golang
At the beginning of the year I needed to make a process faster that was written in PHP. I ran out of ideas on how to do this in PHP, so I gave Go a try. What a major success that turned out to be. The process execution time was shorten significantly: from 1 week to "just" 3 hours. Learning Golang turned out to be a major change in my professional career. But more on that later!

## Aloia CMS
My trusty CMS, Aloia CMS got its first stable version this year and has become a powerhouse for my own projects. Its simplicity and extendability made it a very reliable base for my portfolio and Plant care for Beginners, which I'll talk about next.

## Plant care for Beginners
2020 was THE year for my side projects! All the extra time COVID-19 has given me has allowed me to write many plant care guides for Plant care for Beginners. In May, I enabled Google Adsense and since that point my side project actually started to make me some money. At the beginning of December i switched my ads from Adsense to Mediavine and I hope to stay with them for a while.

## CRO-tool
A friend of mine had a great idea for a new side-project: CRO-tool. This project aims to help UX and CRO professionals to use psychology for their A/B tests. Together, we've worked many hours on getting an MVP off the ground, with some success! We've sold a few early-bird lifetime licenses for our tool and we're planning to release about 20 new psychological theories of the next few months to keep adding value to our subscibers.

## Ansible
During this year, I've been looking at automating everything that could be automated. This included deploying all websites I manage. Up to this point, this has always been a manual process, but using Ansible, I've created playbooks to automate all of my websites. This helps to keep my mind at ease and prevent human error while deploying. I'm no longer at risk of forgetting something during deployments, because this has been automated.

## Neo4j
Neo4j came around quite late in the year, around mid-November. However, in that short time it has changed my views of what a database should be by quite a bit. A database should shape to your needs, not the other way around. If you're working with complex data, you'll often struggle with many joins in a query to get the data you need. Neo4j makes this infinitely times easier and faster to do.

## A new job
During this year, I've found a new job! I've been working at Tubber for the past 5 years and I was ready for the next step. I've found the right place for me at Afosto. At this new job, I'll get to work with Kubernetes, Microservices, and a lot of Golang. I enjoyed working with Go so much that it ultimately resulted in finding a new job where I can use it more often.

## Mastermind group
Since I've had more time to spend on my side-projects, having a Mastermind group has been an amazing experience. This mastermind group has given me new insights and ideas to use to improve my side-projects and make them profitable.
