# Exploration of event storming

Domain Event, it's like telling I story (I did this and then this happened)
- Past tense
- Relevant for the business

Actions: This is what users do (Add item to basket)
- present tense

Everything discussed during the event storming needs to be recorded, for example:
- A user is called a customer. This is an entity.

Rules need to be defined, for example: When reserving an item in the basket, only 1 item can be reserved at a time.
