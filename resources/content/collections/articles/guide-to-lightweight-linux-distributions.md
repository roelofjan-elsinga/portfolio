# 5 lightweight Linux distributions for beginners and experts
As a former Windows user, seeing the enormous amount of Linux distributions (distros) was overwhelming when wanting to start using it on the desktop. There are so many distros out there and they all do different things and serve different purposes. One of the use cases for people to use Linux is to continue using old hardware. When you look at laptops from 5+ years ago, they usually start to slow down to a point of frustration. This is where Mac are at an advantage over Windows users, because Mac laptops don't show their age as early as Windows laptops do. So when the laptops slow down the users assume the laptop is too old and needs to be replaced, even if the laptop is still working properly.

A great way to keep using the same hardware, but not deal with a slow operating system is to install a lightweight Linux distribution on the laptop instead. In this post I'll go over some lightweight, but beginner friendly Linux distributions. I will also include a few more advanced choices for the seasoned Linux users. There are a few that I've used for a while and also a few that are pretty new to me.

## 1. Zorin OS Lite
If you're looking for a Linux distribution specifically for old Windows machines Zorin OS Lite might be your best choice. Zorin OS is specifically designed to make the transition from Windows to Linux painless. The user interface looks very similar to that of Windows. There are a few different versions of Zorin OS: ultimate, core, education, and lite. Since this post is about lightweight Linux distributions I will only talk about the Lite version. The Lite version is able to run on hardware up to 15 years old. That's is quite an impressive claim, but how do they do this? Well, they run a themed XFCE desktop on the Lite version. This means it's very lightweight and most old systems should be able to run it comfortably. 

I didn't want to accept this impressive claim to be true without putting it to the test. At the office there is an old windows system: either a dual core or a low powered quad core processor and 3 gb to 4 gb of RAM. This was running Ubuntu server before, because we all gave up on it being able to run any desktop OS. Now it's running Zorin OS Lite without any problems. It's running at about 350mb RAM, so it has plenty of free memory for other tasks and applications. Overall, it's a great choice to help those coming from Windows to get started with Linux. 

## 2. Ubuntu Mate
With the Raspberry Pi becoming more powerful every version, it won't be long until most people can use this small devices as their main desktop computer. Recently I've gotten the newest version: Raspberry Pi 4 4gb. This currently won't run Ubuntu Mate just yet, but it will in the future. The point is, these small devices are already usable as desktop computers, but they don't have enough resources to run any medium to heavyweight Linux distributions. They need something that's very lightweight. So what's better than the recommended lightweight distribution Raspbian? Well a lightweight distribution that looks great and is built on top of Ubuntu. Don't get me wrong, Raspbian is a great distribution because it just works, but it doesn't look very modern.

I mentioned earlier that Ubuntu Mate doesn't run on the Raspberry Pi 4 just yet, but it does run flawlessly on the Raspberry Pi 3. I'm currently running the distribution on that Raspberry Pi and it's fast and looks familiar. 

2. Zubuntu
4. Peppermint OS
5. Endeavour OS
