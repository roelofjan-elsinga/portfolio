# A guide to lightweight Linux distributions
As a former Windows user, seeing the enormous amount of Linux distributions (distros) was overwhelming when wanting to start using it on the desktop. There are so many distros out there and they all do different things and serve different purposes. One of the use cases for people to use Linux is to continue using old hardware. When you look at laptops from 5+ years ago, they're usually starting to slow down to a point of frustration. This is where Mac users are laughing at Windows users, because Mac laptops don't show their age as early as Windows laptops do. So when the laptops slow down the users assume the laptop is too old and needs to be replaced, even if the laptop is still working properly.
