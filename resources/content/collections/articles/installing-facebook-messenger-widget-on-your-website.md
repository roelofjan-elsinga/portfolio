# Connecting with your target audience: Installing a Facebook Messenger widget on your website

If you've ever published a website and added a page tracker of some sort, you know that people did or did not visit your website. But that's really all you know. You don't know who these people are, you don't know why they're on your website, and what you could help them with. If you're like me, you run a website that intends to help people solve a problem. You can write all the content in the world, but not everyone learns the same way. So adding another way to connect with your visitors could be a great way to help even more people.
