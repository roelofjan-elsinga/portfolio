# Linux: Desktop environments
Desktop environment?! What is a desktop environment? A desktop environment is a set of rules that determine the look and feel of your desktop computer. Usually this determines what the layout of your screen is, where the taskbar goes, and which basic programs are installed on your computer. If those words don't mean anything to you, not to worry. I had now clue desktop environments existed for the first year I used Linux. I thought the default look and feel of Ubuntu was what Linux looked like. This is why I'm adding screenshots of each of the desktop environments I'm talking about in this blog post. 

Linux comes with a wide range of desktop environments, unlike Windows or Mac, which only have one look and feel to the desktop. So why does Linux have so many? Well as you might have read in my previous post ["Linux: Rolling releases vs Snapshot releases"](/articles/linux-rolling-releases-versus-snapshot-releases), Linux is all about what you want and need. In the list below, there are a lot of different reasons people might have to choose a specific desktop environment:

- Customization possibilities
- Performance on old hardware
- Great user experience
- Touch friendliness
- Great out-of-the-box look and feel
- Presence of features and lack their off

These are all priorities people could have to choose a specific desktop environment. Now that we have some example priorities, let's look at some actual desktop environments you can choose from when working with Linux.

## XFCE

XFCE is a very lightweight desktop environment. This means that it uses very little RAM memory, which leaves the rest to you to use for things you want to. Lower resource usage also means that if you have this installed on a laptop, it makes your battery last much longer. As XFCE uses very little resources, it's very fast on new systems and can also run on much older systems. You can use this to your advantage and use your hardware for longer, without upgrading or buying a new system. XFCE can be customized very easily. This means you can change the layout to whatever you want to and let's you change any and all of the colors. The desktop you see in the screenshot above is my laptop, before it was completely transformed into a dark mode desktop with red accent colors. 

- Gnome
- KDE Plasma
- Deepin
- Cinnamon
- Mate
- Pantheon
- Budgie
- LXDE
