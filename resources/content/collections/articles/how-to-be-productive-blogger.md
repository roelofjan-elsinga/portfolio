# How to be a productive blogger
Blogging is easy, but blogging consistently is tough. Consistently posting blog posts is tough, but there are ways to make it easier on yourself. It's also important to determine what your motivation is to write consistently. Any reason is a good reason, as long as it helps to convince yourself that you should stick to some sort of schedule. You don't have to post every single day or week, but you should have a schedule. This isn't for your readers, although it helps, but it's for yourself. It's to keep yourself accountable.
