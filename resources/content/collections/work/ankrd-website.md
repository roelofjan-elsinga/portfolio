# Ankrd

Ankrd is a social media platform for colleges. It aims to be a central point where colleges can post events and 
discuss topics. Every school has its own posts and members. This was the first application that I created using 
the new version of Angular.

### What's my role in this project?
I was responsible for creating the entire platform, from the database to the user interaction. 
I've done this by collaborating with two others to come up with the best way to present the content to the 
user and figuring out what the interaction should be like.

### Tools used
To accomplish this goal, there were several tools I used:
- PHP (laravel)
- JavaScript (Angular)
- MySQL
- SCSS
