## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Roelof Jan! I'm a full-stack developer in Groningen and I enjoy a challenge. I'm currently working as a lead developer at Tubber, a platform to facilitate C2C, C2B, and B2B boat rentals all over the world. I found my challenge in learning and applying new technologies to solve increasingly complicated problems. As a full-stack developer, the problems I'm trying to solve are of a very wide nature. The problems range from cutting the boot time of a website in half to coming up with ways to build the platform in such a way that real-time availability of boats and booking data is possible. Even when you're working with a system that pulls its data from 5 to 10 different sources.
