# My passions

Here you can read about all the things I do in my free-time. 
Unlike my blog posts, which are all about my professional development, 
these are about all the other good things in life. These things keep me 
occupied in my spare time and keep me refreshed on difficult and long days. 
Since my job keeps me glued to my computer for at least 8 hours per day, 
I try to find activities that have nothing to do with computers in the other 
16 hours of the day.
